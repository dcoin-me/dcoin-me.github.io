00:00.000 --> 00:08.300


00:08.300 --> 00:14.300
If you have installed Dcoin to your computer, you should wait for the blockchain update.

00:14.300 --> 00:17.300
Transfer of coins from one Dcoin user to another is available in the anonymous mode.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.800
Ability to finance crowdfunding projects.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.800
Currency exchange on a decentralized exchange.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.800
Ability to become a creditor.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.800
You can also run your own crowdfunding projects.

00:29.800 --> 00:38.800
Let's send coins.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.800
Now our transaction went to the network.

00:41.800 --> 00:51.800
All transactions are encrypted using AES 256-bit key, and the session key is encrypted with 2048-bit public RSA-key of the node.

00:51.800 --> 00:59.300
Here the block came from the network, which sealed our transaction.

00:59.300 --> 01:08.300
Let's take a look at the block and the transaction unassembled.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.300
This is our transaction.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.300
This is our signature made with the private 2,048-bit RSA key.

01:17.300 --> 01:22.300
This is the block's signature made with the private 1024-bit RSA key of the node that generated the block.

01:22.300 --> 01:30.300
You can download the block and disassemble it in any hex-editor.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.300


01:35.300 --> 01:40.300
You need to upgrade your account for mining.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.300
1 miner = 1 person.

01:45.300 --> 02:02.300
Upload photos.

02:02.300 --> 02:08.300
And the video, because video (unlike photo) is impossible to forge.

02:08.300 --> 02:43.300
You will learn later why you need to make these marks.

02:43.300 --> 02:46.300
Url of your node.

02:46.300 --> 02:54.300
You will learn later why you need to specify your location.

02:54.300 --> 02:59.300
The transaction is sent.

02:59.300 --> 03:04.300


03:04.300 --> 03:14.300
Other miners checked our video and photo, the number of positive votes outweighed the negative, and we now have the status of miner.

03:14.300 --> 03:20.300
We can generate and sign blocks.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.300
And we can also verify applicants to miners.

03:25.300 --> 03:39.300
We need to check whether the marks are made correctly. We look where the digit on the left picture is located and check where the picture on the right picture is. The search for clones in a database in run by the marks.

03:39.300 --> 03:46.300
Let's look if there are any clones.

03:46.300 --> 03:54.300
Since the photos can be faked, but video can't be, we need to check if there is the same person in the video and photo.

03:54.300 --> 04:02.300
The transaction went to the network.

04:02.300 --> 04:08.300


04:08.300 --> 04:28.300
I'm ready to buy DUSD 1,000 for $1,000. I need to add the promised amount. I will get a miner's salary in DUSD for being a kind of ATM, which is ready to give $1,000 for DUSD 1,000. 

04:28.300 --> 04:32.300
The transaction went to the network.

04:32.300 --> 04:37.600


04:37.600 --> 04:46.600
I have been waiting for a whole month for someone to decide and sell me DUSD, but nobody did.

04:46.600 --> 04:56.100
I received coins for working as an ATM for a month (it does not matter that no one took advantage of me).

04:56.100 --> 05:00.100
Send the coins to the wallet.

05:00.100 --> 05:11.600
The transaction is sent to the network, you need to wait for the block to come - after this, the coins will appear in the wallet.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.600
Here the block came from the network.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.100
There is DUSD +220 in the wallet now.

05:20.100 --> 05:25.100


05:25.100 --> 05:41.100
If I need cash, I can exchange DUSD for USD with any miner who works as the ATM like I do.

05:41.100 --> 05:51.100
When we upgraded our account, we marked our location. It is needed for miners to find those who are located nearby them.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.100
I choose a miner who is not far from me.

05:55.100 --> 06:04.100
We specify out contact information - it will be encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key of the recipient.

06:04.100 --> 06:12.100
Here's the code I have to give him in exchange for $200.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.100
The transaction went to the network.

06:15.100 --> 06:29.100


06:29.100 --> 06:44.600
If the total number of coins of some currency is greater than the amount of the promised amounts, the "reduction" transaction is automatically generated, which reduces the entire volume of the coins of the distressed currency by 10%.

06:44.600 --> 06:52.600


06:52.600 --> 07:01.600
After one month as I become a miner I got an ability to vote.

07:01.600 --> 07:11.600
Miners can choose the administrator. Anybody can be the administrator if he's got 50% of miners' votes. The administrator may be rechosen fortnightly.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.600
Every miner can be demoted to user by an admin.

07:16.600 --> 07:31.600
If a bot or a someone's clone has become a miner, admin has to demote him to user. Consequently, admin must fix all the mistakes, which can be made by those miners, who are checking the candidates for becoming a miner.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.600
Also it's necessary to assign the number of referral bonuses.

07:36.600 --> 07:46.600
To sign up in Dcoin you need RSA-key, which was signed up by some miner. Miner can make not more than 10 keys per month.

07:46.600 --> 08:01.600
The key user becomes referral of those miner, who signed this key up. When referral sends coins from the promised amount to the wallet, referrer will have a percentage from this amount.

08:01.600 --> 08:16.600
If you don't want to have a referral bonuses in the crypto currency you can put 0 value in every line. Every 2 weeks the votes get converted and the values get reselected.

08:16.600 --> 08:22.600
You can vote for every currency we have in the promised amounts.

08:22.600 --> 08:30.600
An annual percentage determines the speed of new coins' emission.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.600
Maximal promised amount may also be changed by voting.

08:34.600 --> 08:44.600
How many currencies may be mined at the same time.

08:44.600 --> 08:54.600
Also miners can vote for a contraction of the volume of coins of any currency. The contraction happens only if there are more than 50% for such a decision.

08:54.600 --> 09:02.600
It's important not to mix up the contraction of the volume(which happens only by voting) and self-acting 10%-contraction.

09:02.600 --> 09:15.600
Every 2 weeks the votes get converted and the values get reselected.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.600
Transaction went to the DC-network.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.600


09:24.600 --> 09:34.600
For miners' motivation in checking the other miners and voting there are points.

09:34.600 --> 09:47.600
If there are not enough points the coins from the promised amounts will increase with user's percentage. During the first month everybody has the user's percentage, because points calculate monthly.
